List Response
=============
The LIST response is:

{
    "items": [
        { /* each model */ },
    ],
    "count": <int>,
    "nextLink": <url>
}

The count is only included if requested, and the nextLink is fully qualified.

All REST service endpoints support standard conditional requests (If-Match, etc.) and require a ZUMO-API-VERSION: 3.0.0 header

Authentication / Authorization

The service takes an optional Authorization header with Bearer {JWT}.  The JWT is a signed JWT with:

* iss = https://blog-it-service.azure-api.net
* sub = <user id for authors table>

And a key of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

Author entities are automatically added to the authors table on the first post/comment.
